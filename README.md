ODE Solver

This project is a simple numerical solver for ordinary differential equations (ODEs). It uses classical methods such as Euler’s Method and Runge-Kutta 4th Order (RK4) to approximate solutions of first-order differential equations.

The project includes a basic command-line interface and an optional Streamlit-based GUI for interactive use.

Features:
	•	Supports both Euler and RK4 methods
	•	User inputs for functions, initial values, step size, and range
	•	Easy-to-read output
	•	Optional Streamlit app for a graphical interface
